# Uploading Web App Online

Just copy the content of the `build` folder to the necessary folder on your server.

## New Features

- PDFs can be searched by title.
- Searches are case-insensitive.
- Search can be performed with keywords that exist in the title of the PDF.
- The keywords don't have to be in ***no specific order***. e.g To search for a PDF titled **Interstitial Cystitis/Bladder Pain Syndrome**, you can search with the following keyword `interstitial cystitis pain`, or `pain cystitis` or `syndrome interstitial` and so on.
- PDFs can also be filtered by `language`.
- The list of languages is updated automatically `by scrapping the json file for languages`.
